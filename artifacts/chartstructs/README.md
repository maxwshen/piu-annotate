# chartstructs

Contains collections of chartstructs, which can be converted into chart jsons for display.

piucenter-dijkstra-090124/
    Contains 7249 chartstruct csvs, built from old piucenter dataframes from /home/maxwshen/piu-annotate/data/d_annotate/, with limb annotations from the dijkstra approach. 
    These chartstructs can differ from more modern chartstructs for many reasons, including:
    - Updates/changes to .ssc
    - Errors in .ssc parsing that have since been fixed (warps)
    - Old code grouped together very high NPS notes, impacting high level charts
    - Floating point mismatches
